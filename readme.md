# approach taken

I started off wire framing a few pages to what i expected the UX to be like.
But as i started coding and slowly building the app, i realised a few more extra steps/pages were needed in order to make this app more user friendly.

# technologies used

- Followed the CRUD format. 
- Used ActiveRecord.
- Used password authentication.

# unsolved problems

- Any user can access and edit the info
- The CSS is mediocre.
- Did not connect the User_id to the Comments.

# improvements to be made

- Add an api.
- connect the user to the comment.
- improve css.
- Add a time range feature rather than using integers.
